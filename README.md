- 👋 Hi, I’m @Millbean
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical engineering, control systems, arduino, raspberry pi
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in arduino IDE, MATLAB, Simulink, LabView
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. But I don't know a lot yet so I wouldn't be much help in a collaboration.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't know if there is a message system in github but if so, contact me throught that.
